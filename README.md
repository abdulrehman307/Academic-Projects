# Academic Computer Science Projects

This repository contains my academic projects completed during my Computer Science degree. These projects were developed as part of my coursework while learning core programming concepts and problem-solving techniques.

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my learning progress during my university studies, not production-level software.

##  C++ Projects

I have completed four C++ projects during my academic semesters. These projects helped me understand programming fundamentals, file handling, and logical thinking.

### 1. Blood Donation System (C++)
- Console-based application
- Uses file handling to store and retrieve data
- Manages donor and blood groups availability information and basic operations

### 2. Student Managment System (C++)
- Command-line based system
- Save the student data
- Focus on control structures

### 3. Contact Managment System (C++)
- Command-line based system
- Save the Contacts Information, sort them and seach from them
- Focus on Data Structures 
- 
### 3. Additional C++ Projects
- Small academic programs focused on logic building
- Implemented during different semesters as practice work

## 🧩 Assembly Language Project

### Car Parking System (Assembly Language)
- Developed as part of my Assembly Language course
- Focused on understanding registers, memory usage, and low-level logic
- Implemented core parking functionality with file handling

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- C++
- Assembly Language
- File Handling
- Command Line Interface (CLI)

---

## What I Learned
- Writing structured and readable code
- Applying file handling concepts in C++
- Understanding low-level programming using assembly language
- Improving logical thinking through academic problem-solving
